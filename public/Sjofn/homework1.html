    <br/>There are too many incrementalists in tech these days, according to Paul Biggar, who along with Ellen Chisa, is unveiling the Dark, a programming language aimed at making deploying software simpler.
    <br/>“The <b>complexity</b> of building backends today is just out of control. It’s infrastructure, it’s deployment, it’s APIs… Dark is about removing all this complexity,” Biggar said.
    <br/>The technology involves a holistic programming language, structured editor and infrastructure for building backend web services.
    <br/>“We keep adding things, but we never take things away. AWS has 200 services and never takes any away,” he said, calling garbage collection the last really good innovation in the industry.
